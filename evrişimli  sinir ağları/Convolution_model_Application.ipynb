    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/supplement/DS4yP/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace)."

Don't worry, you'll be spending more time with skip connections very soon! "

    "### 4.3 - Forward Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, there are built-in functions that implement the convolution steps for you. By now, you should be familiar with how TensorFlow builds computational graphs. In the [Functional API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional), you create a graph of layers. This is what allows such great flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the following model could also be defined using the Sequential API since the information flow is on a single line. But don't deviate. What we want you to learn is to use the functional API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin building your graph of layers by creating an input node that functions as a callable object:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **input_img = tf.keras.Input(shape=input_shape):** \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, create a new node in the graph of layers by calling a layer on the `input_img` object: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters= ... , kernel_size= ... , padding='same')(input_img):** Read the full documentation on [Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D(pool_size=(f, f), strides=(s, s), padding='same'):** `MaxPool2D()` downsamples your input using a window of size (f, f) and strides of size (s, s) to carry out max pooling over each window.  For max pooling, you usually operate on a single example at a time and a single channel at a time. Read the full documentation on [MaxPool2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.keras.layers.ReLU():** computes the elementwise ReLU of Z (which can be any shape). You can read the full documentation on [ReLU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/ReLU).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.keras.layers.Flatten()**: given a tensor \"P\", this function takes each training (or test) example in the batch and flattens it into a 1D vector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    * If a tensor P has the shape (batch_size,h,w,c), it returns a flattened tensor with shape (batch_size, k), where $k=h \\times w \\times c$.  \"k\" equals the product of all the dimension sizes other than the first dimension.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * For example, given a tensor with dimensions [100, 2, 3, 4], it flattens the tensor to be of shape [100, 24], where 24 = 2 * 3 * 4.  You can read the full documentation on [Flatten](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.keras.layers.Dense(units= ... , activation='softmax')(F):** given the flattened input F, it returns the output computed using a fully connected layer. You can read the full documentation on [Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last function above (`tf.keras.layers.Dense()`), the fully connected layer automatically initializes weights in the graph and keeps on training them as you train the model. Hence, you did not need to initialize those weights when initializing the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, before creating the model, you'll need to define the output using the last of the function's compositions (in this example, a Dense layer): \n",

    "#### Window, kernel, filter, pool\n",
    "\n",
    "The words \"kernel\" and \"filter\" are used to refer to the same thing. The word \"filter\" accounts for the amount of \"kernels\" that will be used in a single convolution layer. \"Pool\" is the name of the operation that takes the max or average value of the kernels. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the parameter `pool_size` refers to `kernel_size`, and you use `(f,f)` to refer to the filter size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pool size and kernel size refer to the same thing in different objects - They refer to the shape of the window where the operation takes place. "
